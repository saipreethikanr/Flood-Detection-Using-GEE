# Flood-Detection-Using-GEE
Flooding is a major issue worldwide, especially in cities like Chennai during the rainy season. Traditional detection methods, such as ground surveys and regular satellite images, have limitations—surveys take time and cover small areas, while satellite images struggle with cloud cover.

SAR (Synthetic Aperture Radar) technology overcomes these challenges by using radar waves to penetrate clouds and provide clear ground images. This project utilizes Sentinel-1 SAR data for reliable flood monitoring, even in bad weather.

Processing SAR data efficiently is made possible with Google Earth Engine (GEE), a cloud-based platform for handling large datasets. By combining SAR’s accuracy with GEE’s fast processing, we can detect and analyze flooding across Chennai, aiding disaster response and planning.
