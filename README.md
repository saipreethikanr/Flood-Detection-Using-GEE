# Flood-Detection-Using-GEE
Flooding is a major issue worldwide, especially in cities like Chennai during the rainy season. Traditional detection methods, such as ground surveys and regular satellite images, have limitations—surveys take time and cover small areas, while satellite images struggle with cloud cover.

SAR (Synthetic Aperture Radar) technology overcomes these challenges by using radar waves to penetrate clouds and provide clear ground images. This project utilizes Sentinel-1 SAR data for reliable flood monitoring, even in bad weather.

Processing SAR data efficiently is made possible with Google Earth Engine (GEE), a cloud-based platform for handling large datasets. By combining SAR’s accuracy with GEE’s fast processing, we can detect and analyze flooding across Chennai, aiding disaster response and planning.

## OBJECTIVE

This study aims to develop a reliable, reusable method for flood detection using Sentinel-1 radar data in Google Earth Engine (GEE). Sentinel-1’s radar signals penetrate clouds, enabling flood detection even in bad weather. GEE allows fast processing and analysis of large satellite datasets to identify water-covered areas.  

Beyond detecting a single flood event, the goal is to create a repeatable process that can be used for future floods in Chennai and other flood-prone cities, ensuring effective monitoring anytime and anywhere.
